here's a Java program that finds the intersection of two arrays using a HashSet: In this program, we first create two arrays called array1 and array2. We then create two HashSet objects called set1 and set2. We add all the elements of array1 to set1 and all the elements of array2 to set2. We then use the retainAll() method to find the intersection of set1 and set2, and store the result back in set1. Finally, we print out the contents of set1, which gives us the intersection of array1 and array2.
